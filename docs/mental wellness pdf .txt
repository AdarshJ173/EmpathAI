PROPOSAL REPORT
Generative AI for Youth Mental Wellness
GenAI Exchange Hackathon
1. Problem Statement
Mental health issues among youth are rising at an alarming pace. However:
• Many hesitate to approach therapists due to stigma or fear of judgment.
• Therapy for conditions like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) happens only in controlled
office settings, leaving youth without support in their real-world triggers.
• Continuous, real-time guidance outside therapy is missing, creating a gap between
professional help and everyday struggles.
There is an urgent need for an AI-powered solution that provides empathetic companionship,
therapy reinforcement, and proactive monitoring—all accessible 24×7.
2. Solution Overview
We propose a two-layered AI platform that combines:
1. EmpathAI – an emotional support companion for anyone hesitant to seek therapy.
2. OCD Support Module – a structured, therapist-integrated tool providing both short-term and
long-term assistance.
Together, these create a hybrid ecosystem that is reactive (responding to emotional needs and OCD
urges) and proactive (predicting stress cycles using wearable integration).
3. Key Features
1. EmpathAI – Emotional Expression Companion
• Target Audience: Youth who feel uncomfortable seeking therapy.
• Provides a safe, AI-powered space for free emotional expression.
• Acts as a judgment-free listener to help users release stress and gain clarity.
• Can serve as the first step toward professional help.
2. OCD Support Module – Therapy-Integrated Tool
a) Long-Term ERP Support
• Tracks triggers and arranges them into a hierarchy.
• Provides gradual exposure with timed delays before compulsions.
• Delay time is systematically increased to build resistance.
• Helps replicate and reinforce ERP (Exposure and Response Prevention) outside therapy
sessions.
b) Short-Term (Crisis Mode)
For overwhelming urges, users can choose:
• Reassurance Mode
o Used when obsessions and compulsions are logically connected.
o Provides rational explanations and logical counterpoints.
o Extends from EmpathAI chat, but specialized for OCD cases.
• SOS Mode (for non-logical obsessions & compulsions)
o Distract Me: Redirects attention via:
▪ Sensory games
▪ Calming visual timers
▪ Grounding activities (“name 5 things you see around you”)
o Work Mode:
▪ Subtle pop-up overlay on the user’s screen.
▪ Shows motivational nudges, calming messages, or task reminders.
▪ Helps the user redirect from obsession to ongoing work.
c) Therapist Portal
• Secure dashboard for therapists.
• Tracks:
o Compulsion frequency
o ERP progress (delay times, trigger exposure success)
o SOS/Reassurance usage patterns
• Enables data-backed personalization of therapy.
d.)Predictive Wellness with Wearables (Fitbit Integration)
• Data Sources: Heart rate, HRV, stress, activity, sleep.
• AI Cycle Detection:
o HR spike + HRV drop → possible obsession onset
o Repetitive motion → compulsion
o HR stabilization → relief
• Advantages:
➢ Captures physiological changes that indicate stress, obsessions, or
compulsions—even if the user does not consciously report them.
➢ Provides early warnings before, during, or after an obsessive
episode, based on body signals.
➢ Ensures support is available even when users feel too overwhelmed
or hesitant to share.
➢ Bridges the gap between subjective self-reporting and objective
biometric detection.
• Outputs:
o Daily AI-generated Wellness Score (progress vs. past self).
o Therapist dashboard showing trends over time.
e) Daily AI Wellness Score
• Personalized mental health progress tracker.
• Encourages self-reflection and positive reinforcement.
• Turns improvement into a gamified, motivating journey.
4. Impact
• Reduces stigma by offering a private, non-judgmental first step.
• Empowers OCD patients with real-time coping tools outside therapy.
• Supports therapists with objective, data-driven insights.
• Predicts stress cycles, enabling early intervention.
• Creates a scalable, 24×7 AI-powered mental wellness ecosystem.
5. Conclusion
Our solution merges empathetic AI conversations, ERP reinforcement, wearable-driven predictive
analytics, and therapist integration into a unified platform.
• For hesitant youth, it is a safe space to share and heal.
• For OCD patients, it is a continuous therapeutic companion.
• For therapists, it is a data-rich support tool.
By bridging the gap between office-based therapy and real-world mental health needs, this project
aims to deliver 24×7 proactive care for youth mental wellness.
